A [recent article](https://www.postandcourier.com/news/slowly-but-surely-south-carolina-s-incredibly-complex-shoreline-is/article_46e18626-cde8-11e6-be82-6393ed1dbe62.html) in the *Post and Courier* on sea level rise got my attention. 
I think it would be great exercise for my students to examine the raw data. 
It is quite simple to download historic data for a single station.
Unfortunately I found that NOAA's api only allows you to automate the downloading of water level data for the past 30 days.
Although the great folks at RopenSci have created the R package [`rnoaa`](https://github.com/ropensci/rnoaa) it does not appear that this tool
will work for the historic data until NOAA provides long-term search for this
data produce on their API.

This data comes from the [NOAA Charleston, Cooper River Entrance, SC - Station ID: 8665530](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stationhome.html?id=8665530).

```{r read data in}
# url for data: 
# https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/waterlevels.html?id=8665530&units=standard&bdate=19211001&edate=20501101&timezone=GMT&datum=MLLW&interval=m&action=data
# metadata on data fields: 
# https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/datum_options.html
water_ht <- read.csv('./data/CO-OPS__8665530__ml.csv')
head(water_ht)
# make a date variable
water_ht$date <- with(water_ht, 
                      as.Date(paste(Year, Month, 01, sep = "-")))
```

Let's now examine some of the long and short term trends in the data:

```{r examine trends in mean sea level}
msl_lm = lm(MSL ~ date, data = water_ht)

plot(MSL ~ date, data = water_ht, type = 'l', col = 'grey', 
     xlab = 'Date', ylab = 'Mean sea level (m)')
lines(with(water_ht, lowess(date, MSL, f = 0.1)), col = 'red', lwd=2)
abline(msl_lm, col = 'blue', lwd = 2)
```

Clearly there is a long-term positive trend in increasing sea level rise that
appears to be accelerating in the last decade or so.
